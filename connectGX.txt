It seems like you're trying to use **Great Expectations** to validate the data in your Pandas DataFrame (`df`) by running a validation check on a column called `"Boxes"`. You are also trying to initialize the Great Expectations context and use a pandas-based validator.

However, there are a few things that need to be adjusted to make it compatible with **Great Expectations version 1.3.7**. Specifically, the code has to handle the way Great Expectations works with context, batch requests, and expectations more explicitly.

### Issues with the Current Code:
- `gx.get_context()` is not the correct approach for **version 1.3.7**. You need to initialize a `DataContext` and specify the path to the project.
- Instead of using `context.sources.pandas_default.read_dataframe(df)`, we need to wrap the DataFrame into a **batch** and then use a **validator**.
- Expectations should be added to a **Validator** object, which is tied to a batch.

Let's rewrite your code for **Great Expectations version 1.3.7**:

### Rewritten Code for **Great Expectations version 1.3.7**:

```python
import great_expectations as gx
import pandas as pd
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from great_expectations.core.batch import BatchRequest

# Connection string to the SQL Server
server_name = "DESKTOP-A6R8AFJ\\SQLEXPRESS01"
database_name = "Awesome"
connection_string = f"mssql+pyodbc://{server_name}/{database_name}?driver=ODBC+Driver+17+for+SQL+Server&trusted_connection=yes&charset=utf8"

# Create SQLAlchemy engine and connect
engine = create_engine(connection_string)
connection = engine.connect()

# SQL query to fetch data
query = "SELECT TOP 10 * FROM [dbo].[sales]"

# Execute query and load data into DataFrame
try:
    df = pd.read_sql(query, engine)
    print("Query Executed Successfully")
    print(df)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error Occurred: {e}")

# Initialize Great Expectations context with the path to the project
context = gx.data_context.DataContext("D:/Aryabhat/ScriptPython/great_expectations")

# Create a BatchRequest
batch_request = BatchRequest(
    datasource_name="pandas",  # Default datasource name for pandas dataframes
    data_connector_name="default_inferred_data_connector",  # Inferred data connector
    data_asset_name="sales_data",  # Name of the data asset (just an example name)
    batch_identifiers={"default_identifier_name": "default_identifier_value"}  # Optional identifiers
)

# Create a Batch (this will wrap the dataframe as a batch)
batch = context.get_batch(batch_request)

# Create a Validator for the batch
validator = context.get_validator(batch)

# Add expectations to the validator
validator.expect_column_values_to_be_between(
    column="Boxes", 
    min_value=10, 
    max_value=10000
)

# Run validation and print results
results = validator.validate()
print(results)
```

### Key Changes and Details:
1. **Initializing `DataContext`**:
   - You need to initialize the **Great Expectations context** (`DataContext`) by providing the path to the directory where your `great_expectations.yml` file is located.
   - In this example, the path is `"D:/Aryabhat/ScriptPython/great_expectations"`.

2. **BatchRequest and Batch Creation**:
   - In **version 1.3.7**, you need to create a `BatchRequest` that defines the data source, data connector, and data asset.
   - The `batch` is created by calling `context.get_batch(batch_request)`.

3. **Creating a Validator**:
   - After creating a batch, you use `context.get_validator(batch)` to create a **Validator**.
   - The **Validator** is used to add expectations to the batch (e.g., `expect_column_values_to_be_between`).

4. **Running the Validation**:
   - The validation results are obtained by calling `validator.validate()`, and the results are printed.

### Additional Setup:

1. **Datasource Setup**: 
   - The `BatchRequest` uses `"pandas"` as the datasource, which refers to the default pandas DataFrame configuration. If you haven't set up a **datasource** in your **Great Expectations** project, you can do so with the following CLI command:

     ```bash
     great_expectations datasource new
     ```

   - Make sure the `pandas` datasource and the `default_inferred_data_connector` are correctly set up in your **Great Expectations** configuration.

2. **Expectations Configuration**:
   - You are adding an expectation on the `"Boxes"` column of the DataFrame to ensure its values are between 10 and 10,000. You can add more expectations as needed.

### Conclusion:
The changes above should make your code compatible with **Great Expectations version 1.3.7**. The key part is to correctly initialize the **DataContext** and use the **BatchRequest** and **Validator** to apply expectations.
